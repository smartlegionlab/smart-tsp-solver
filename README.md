> **Research-driven design:** This library implements cutting-edge spatial optimization 
> techniques including **dynamic gravitational attraction modeling** and **angular-radial 
> spatial indexing** for intelligent pathfinding.

## üöÄ Features

*   **üß† Dynamic Gravity Algorithms:** Physics-inspired approach simulating momentum and gravitational attraction for natural, efficient routing
*   **üìä Angular-Radial Methods:** Space-partitioning heuristics with adaptive look-ahead for superior performance on geographical data
*   **‚ö° Benchmarking Framework:** Professional-grade testing infrastructure with configurable scenarios and detailed metrics
*   **ü¶æ High-Performance Core:** Numba JIT compilation with cache optimization for near-native execution speed

## üî¨ Scientific Foundation

### Algorithmic Innovations

**Dynamic Gravity Approach:** Models city selection using principles of physical attraction and momentum conservation, creating smoother paths that minimize cross-cluster backtracking.

**Angular-Radial Method:** Employs polar coordinate transformation with intelligent sector prioritization, significantly reducing search space for clustered distributions.

### Benchmarking Methodology

All algorithms are compared against a **highly optimized greedy implementation** featuring:
- Numba JIT compilation with `fastmath` and caching
- Euclidean distance optimization with squared distance comparisons
- Memory-efficient visited node tracking
- Reproducible results through seed-based initialization

This ensures fair comparison against a professionally implemented baseline rather than naive reference implementations.

## üì¶ Installation and Run

### Install

```bash
pip install smart-tsp-solver
```


### Parameter Guidance

**Dynamic-gravity:**
```python
# Balanced configuration
route = dynamic_gravity_tsp_v2(cities, delta=0.5, fast_2opt_iter=100)
```

**Angular-radial:**
```python
# Standard configuration
route = angular_radial_tsp_v2(cities, look_ahead=1000, max_2opt_iter=100)
```

### Run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/smartlegionlab/smart-tsp-heuristics.git
